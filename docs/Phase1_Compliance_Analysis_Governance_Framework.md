## Introduction
Six Rings is a regional bank that operates a **trading desk** executing equity orders for retail and institutional clients.  

The bank seeks to modernize its **trade capture and analytics platform** to:

- Detect fraud and unusual trading patterns.  
- Meet strict **regulatory requirements** (SEC, FINRA, CAT, AML, etc.).  
- Improve execution quality (Transaction Cost Analysis, slippage monitoring, liquidity tracking).  
- Provide **auditable records** for regulators, compliance teams, and internal supervisors.  

Modernization also enables scalability, improved data governance, and a foundation for cloud-based analytics and machine learning.

## Key Terms
- **Equity Trade Blotter** – A broker-dealer’s master record of all trades in a given day. Includes times, instrument details, size, price, accounts, and trader IDs.  
- **T+0 (Trade Date)** – Execution, allocation, and affirmation must be completed on trade date.  
- **T+1 (Settlement Date)** – Ownership of securities and cash must settle the day after the trade date. Delays can cause failures and regulatory breaches.  
- **FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority)** – U.S. self-regulatory organization for broker-dealers, overseen by the SEC.  
- **SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)** – U.S. government regulator of securities markets and broker-dealers.  
- **CAT (Consolidated Audit Trail)** – SEC-mandated system to capture all order and execution events across U.S. equities and options.  
- **AML (Anti-Money Laundering)** – Regulatory framework requiring surveillance and suspicious activity reporting (SARs).  
- **Best Execution** – Broker-dealer duty to seek the most favorable execution terms for clients.  

---

## Purpose & Scope
- **Objective:** Map **regulatory obligations** to trade blotter fields, controls, ownership, and evidence to ensure compliance across all client and principal trading activity.  
- **Scope:**  
  - Covers equity agency, principal, and riskless principal activity.  
  - Applies to both **retail and institutional** clients.  
  - Includes integration with compliance functions (surveillance, reporting, suitability).  
- **Assumptions:**  
  - The trading desk operates as a broker-dealer within a banking group.  
  - Some desks may also be subject to **CFTC/NFA** rules (for futures) and **fixed income reporting** (TRACE/RTRS).  
  - This analysis focuses on equities but provides a framework extendable to other asset classes.

## Top 3 Critical Governance Areas

### 1. Recordkeeping Failure ([SEC 17a-3/4](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-44992.htm))
**Risk:** Inaccurate or missing order/execution records could lead to failed audits, fines, and inability to prove compliance.  

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
- **Immutable Storage (WORM):** Store blotter data in Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) compliant storage (e.g., AWS Glacier Vault Lock, Azure Immutable Blob) to ensure records cannot be altered.  
- **Automated Timestamp Capture:** Enforce system-generated UTC timestamps at every order lifecycle stage (receive, execution, allocation).  
- **Data Lineage Tracking:** Maintain audit trails (`lineage_id`, `processing_version`) for every record to prove integrity.  
- **Daily Reconciliation:** Automate daily reconciliation of trade blotter vs. clearing broker records; flag mismatches and escalate.  
- **Periodic Retrieval Drills:** Perform quarterly “retrieval tests” where compliance officers must pull records by `trade_id`, `instrument`, or date to validate searchability.  

---

### 2. Best Execution Breach ([FINRA 5310](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/5310) / [Reg NMS 605/606](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/nmsrule605-606-guidelines.htm))
**Risk:** Clients may receive inferior prices compared to available markets; regulators could levy fines and reputational damage could erode trust.  

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
- **Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA):** Implement real-time TCA dashboards comparing execution prices against NBBO benchmarks, venue averages, and slippage thresholds.  
- **Routing Exception Capture:** Log and review all instances where orders are routed away from best-priced venues, documenting rationale (e.g., client-directed orders, venue outages).  
- **Execution Committees:** Hold monthly Best Execution Committee meetings to review TCA metrics, exception reports, and market structure changes.  
- **Public Disclosures:** Automate quarterly Rule 605 and monthly Rule 606 reports, publishing them on the firm’s website.  
- **Surveillance Models:** Deploy post-trade surveillance to detect patterns of systematically poor execution (e.g., repeated routing to affiliated venues with worse fills).  

---

### 3. Suitability Violation ([Reg BI](https://www.sec.gov/regulation-best-interest) / [FINRA 2111](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/2111))
**Risk:** Inappropriate recommendations or executions for retail accounts could lead to client harm, arbitration cases, and regulatory enforcement.  

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
- **Pre-Trade Suitability Checks:** Build automated pre-trade validation rules that block orders violating account suitability (e.g., margin restrictions, options approval levels).  
- **Client Profiling Integration:** Link trade blotter to CRM/KYC systems to retrieve client risk tolerance, investment objectives, and financial profile at time of trade.  
- **Retail/Institutional Flagging:** Enforce account-level classification (`retail_flag`, `institutional_flag`) with mandatory system enforcement.  
- **Disclosure & Consent Capture:** Automate delivery and acknowledgment of Reg BI disclosures (e.g., principal trades, complex products).  
- **Surveillance Reports:** Generate daily suitability exception reports (e.g., high-risk accounts trading leveraged ETFs); escalate to compliance for review.  
- **Training & Attestations:** Require periodic trader attestations that they understand Reg BI/2111 obligations, with compliance monitoring.
